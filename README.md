Web Server for simplifying the tasks of agrologists made for UIUC Bud Labs Hackathon.

Our goal was to simplify the job of agronomists in helping farmers identify plant diseases. After discussing with local agronomists to identify the shortcomings of their current system, we realized their primary issues were needing to drive many hours a day just to reach farmers and having difficulty in identifying plant diseases by eyesight. Our groupâ€™s multi-step approach included web and mobile applications to allow farmers to send high resolution images to a web server and request specific agronomists for the appropriate identification. In addition, the server would perform image processing, pixel information analysis in order to help agronomists make conclusions more accurately.
